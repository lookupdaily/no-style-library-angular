# No styles angular

A personal playground to explore creating a component library of custom form elements using Angular, with a focus on function over form.

I have used this project as a useful base to develop patterns for component tests based on the [page object model](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom) pattern - with the aim of creating more maintainable, understandable tests. After adding this pattern I was able to change testing frameworks quickly and easily too.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npx ng generate component component-name --project="no-style"` to generate a new library component. 

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests with Jest.
